How to talk to a database SQL: Structured Query Language

Pronounced "sequel" for Microsoft products e.g. SQLServer
Pronounced "s-q-l" for most other DBs
Very common query language, used by many major databases
Used to query database, and send the database commands to carry out
Some variations between DBs, but SQL basics are the same or very similar between databases
So, learning SQL enables you to communicate with most databases

SQL

Databases often speak SQL
You need to construct SQL statements to ask the database to do tasks
A SQL statement can
-create a table
-add data to a table
-fetch data from a table
-delete data from a table
-modify data
-delete a table
-And many other operations…
We need to wrap the SQL statements into Java method calls so your program can send them to the database

***SQL statements – creating a table (slide 24)***

String createTableSQL = "CREATE TABLE cats (name TEXT, age INTEGER)";
statement.executeUpdate(createTableSQL);

CREATE TABLE cats (name TEXT, age INTEGER)

This is a SQL statement instructing the database
to create a table called cats with two columns, one called name that stores text.
The second column is called age and stores integer data.

Remember the order that the columns are in. (will need to insert data in the same order)

Other SQL statements can add data, fetch data, modify data, delete data, delete tables.

***SQL statements – adding data to a table***

String addDataSQL = "INSERT INTO cats VALUES ('Maru', 10)";
statement.executeUpdate(addDataSQL);

INSERT INTO cats VALUES ('Maru', 10)

This is a SQL statement instructing the database to add a row of data to the cats table.
The data goes in the parentheses, in the same order as the columns were defined in
the table.

Strings are enclosed in single quotes.

Table names, column names, and SQL keywords (create table, insert into, values...) are not case sensitive.

String/text data is case sensitive.

**SQL queries: reading data **

SELECT statements used to read data
SELECT * FROM cats gets all the columns and rows (select all from cats)
    -We'll use row and column filters soon
Use statement.executeQuery(sql) method
    //this ^^ is a query that will return some data
Data is returned in a ResultSet

***ResultSet***

How much data will be returned from the query?
Between 0 and millions (maybe billions?) of rows
Loading all the data into memory could be bad or may be impossible
So, must access the data using a ResultSet, one row at a time

Loop over the ResultSet using the next() method in a while loop
The next() method returns true if there is another row to read, false otherwise

  String getAllDataSQL = "SELECT * FROM cats";
  ResultSet allCats = statement.executeQuery(getAllDataSQL);

  while(allCats.next()) {
  //returns true if there are more rows to read,
  //false if all the rows have been read (so ends when the data is out)
  }
        String catName = allCats.getString("name");
        int catAge = allCats.getInt("age");
        System.out.println(catName + " is " + catAge + " years old");
        System.out.printf("%s is %d years old\n", catName, catAge);

Read data from one DB row at a time
  getString(colName) method for TEXT columns,
  getInt(colName) for INTEGER columns,
  getDouble(colName) for REAL columns
    **REAL is for floating point numbers, in Java you'll use double
