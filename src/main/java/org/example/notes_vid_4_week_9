How to talk to a database SQL: Structured Query Language

Pronounced "sequel" for Microsoft products e.g. SQLServer
Pronounced "s-q-l" for most other DBs
Very common query language, used by many major databases
Used to query database, and send the database commands to carry out
Some variations between DBs, but SQL basics are the same or very similar between databases
So, learning SQL enables you to communicate with most databases

SQL

Databases often speak SQL
You need to construct SQL statements to ask the database to do tasks
A SQL statement can
-create a table
-add data to a table
-fetch data from a table
-delete data from a table
-modify data
-delete a table
-And many other operationsâ€¦
We need to wrap the SQL statements into Java method calls so your program can send them to the database
